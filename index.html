              <p>I graduated highschool in 2010 and went on to complete 3 years of college before I realized my inability to commit to something at that time. I started at <em class="school">Oregon State University</em> for my freshman year, then transferred to <em class="school">University of Oregon</em> for the next two.</p>
              <p>During the summer of 2011, I went on a 30 day backpacking expedition through the <em class="school">NOLS</em> program, standing for National Outdoor Leadership School. We hiked 180 miles across Washington state, venturing into the Pasaytan Wilderness and even into parts of Canada when we were straddling the border. I was able to experience complete one-ness with nature as a result of having no electronic ammenities and a distinct focus on "Leave No Trace" environmental principles.</p>

                <div class="col-md-3 seasons">
                  <p>Up until around 2014, I mainly worked seasonal jobs and summers due to being a full-time student. I worked as a(n)</p>

                <div class="col-md-5 americorps">
                  <p>Then I decided to enlist in a federal program called <span class="strong">Americorps NCCC</span>. I spent 10 months in the deep south living, and essentially volunteering (we were given 120$ every 2 weeks), with 7 other people between the ages of 18-24. We spent every waking moment together: moving around between makeshift living spaces in our 15 passenger van. We worked with organizations such as</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Habitat for Humanity</li>
                    <li>The Salvation Army</li>
                    <li>The Girlscouts of America</li>
                    <li>and many others</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We travelled from our home-base in Vicksburg, Mississippi to various project sites in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Louisianna, Tennesse, and others. Generally we spent around 5 weeks at each project site.

                  <p>I spent the past 8 months working retail for a company I love, called Orchard Supply Hardware. The employees of this store are second to none and quickly became a home away from home for me.<p>

              <h4>Video-games<h4>
              <p>I have grown up with a love for video games. I started out playing Battle Toads on the Super Nintendo when I was in daycare and haven't shyed away since. My favorite games would have to be</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Overwatch (for pc)</li>
                <li>League of Legends</li>

              <h4>Tv and Movies<h4>
              <p>As I've gotten older I've learned to appreciate certain aspects of TV and movies in different light. I definitely wouldn't consider myself a critic of any sort because I am unable to subject myself to certain genres, like Horror, or even just shows and movies that are based in content I don't find compelling.

            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <div class="music">
                <p> I am a wildly musical person. I really really <em>really</em> enjoy singing, mostly to myself, but sometimes outloud when I am happy enough. (<span class="silly">Hopefully you won't be subjected to such foulness</span>).
